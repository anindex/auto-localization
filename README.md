# Kidnapped robot problem localization
The repo implements the approach solving kidnapped robot problem using observations from wifi signal and range sensor. 

This repo is the code base for our research "An
approach for robust localization in a prior map using Wifi signal and
range sensor". Proceedings will be updated soon.
